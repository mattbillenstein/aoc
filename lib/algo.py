    Couple explanations:

    Picks Theorem: A = i + b/2 - 1
        This is the interior (zero-width border) area

        For area with a border, basic algebra lets us solve: i = A - b/2 + 1,
        which then implies: i + b = A + b/2 + 1

        Geometrically, Picks will include half the border - 1, so we add back
        half the border + 1 to get the full area

    ------

    Calculating i + b from the Pick's theorem, using the Shoelace formula to
    calculate the area

    i + b = A + b/2 + 1

    b (the number of integer points on the shape's boundary) is just our
    shape's perimeter, which we can easily calculate.

    We can use the Shoelace formula to calculate A, but that's not the area we
    are looking for, as it is only the area inside the shape, not counting the
    boundaries.

    The actual area we are looking for is i + b, which is the number of integer
    points within and on the shape's boundary. As we already know A and b, we
    only have to find i, which is, after transforming the Pick's to look for
    it, i = A - b/2 + 1. We add b to both sides of the equation, and what we
    get is i + b = A + b/2 + 1, which is our answer.
